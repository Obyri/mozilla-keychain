1.1.6
- Fix "Manage Passwords..." button on the security preferences panel
- Improve logging when signon.debug is true
- Support for specifying which keychain to use:
  - extensions.macos-keychain@fitzell.ca.write-keychain: a path to a keychain
     to use for storing passwords (e.g. ~/Library/Keychains/my.keychain)
  - extensions.macos-keychain@fitzell.ca.search-keychains: a list of keychains
     (separated by colons) to use when searching for passwords
- Implement nsILoginStorage.isLoggedIn to always return true (see
   https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=839961)
- Log warnings to console on startup if signon.autofillForms or
   signon.rememberSignons are false

1.1.5
- Fix a bug causing an import prompt on every startup for new installations

1.1.4
- Fix null pointer exception in some cases when loading the password from
  a KeychainItem
- Include the error code provided by the operating system when an error
  is returned from system functions.
- Ensure that all errors returned from the Security.framework are thrown
  and either displayed by LoginManager or logged by MacOSKeychainStorage.js
  (LoginManager seems to silently consume errors thrown by countLogins()
  and findLogins())
- Return an empty string instead of null from LoginInfo.password when a
  user disallows access to the keychain item. This is weird but necessary
  because LoginManager checks every password's length early in the
  process after calling findLogins().
- Detect signon.debug changing so that logging can be enabled and disabled
  without restarting.
- Add a check on startup and warn if the appliction does not verify
  successfully against its signature.

1.1.3
- Update install.rdf to indicate support for Thunderbird 9.0 as reported by
  users (versions 10 and greater should ignore the maxVersion spec)
- Issue 45: Does not work with Thunderbird LDAP

1.1.2
- Issue 39: Version 1.1.1 no longer searchs all keychains

1.1.1
- Issue 34: Import to Keychain fails
- Begin repackaging code into more modules

1.1
- fix a reference to undeclared variable i
- fix an error after adding an item caused by a typo in the name of
  the constant representing success
- Add a temp workaround to keep Firefox Sync working by shunting all related
  requests to default storage instead

1.1pre2
- improved logging

1.1pre1
- CAUTION: This version has been heavily rewritten and only lightly
  tested. I recommend BACKING UP YOUR KEYCHAIN before using it.
- Change to using js-ctypes instead of binary components. This
  should eliminate binary compatibility issues, and means the
  add-on should now work with recent FF 4.x betas. However this version
  currently depends on carbon APIs that are only available in
  OS X 10.6.
- Introduce XUL overlay to remove 'Show Passwords' button in the
  preferences dialog and provide a button that launches Keychain
  Access.

1.0.1:
- update component registration to work with Gecko 2.0 (Firefox 4.0)
- I can't figure out how to get the component working in FF 3.6 at
  the same time and don't have the resources to maintain compatibility
  across intel/ppc, 3 versions of OS X, and several versions of FF.
  This version works only on intel architectures. It works in OS X 10.6
  and hopefully in 10.5 (somebody please test). It will only work with
  Firefox 4.

1.0b1:
- improve logging when creating URIs/URLs fails
- handle failure of URL creation from hostname gracefully by storing in
  legacy storage instead (these can later be stored as generic items maybe)
- If no items are found while searching, try searching the legacy storage db.
  This bides us time until a migration is implemented... at least you can use your
  old passwords. Of course, you also aren't prompted to store them in the Keychain.
- Fix for Firefox 3.0, which doesn't have mozStorage component
- Add a getter to nsLoginInfo classes to have them lookup the password as needed
  from the converted KeychainItem. This avoids prompting the user for permission
  until Mozilla actually *needs* the password.
- Implement a basic migration when the extension is first loaded

1.0a7:
- fix problem causing all new keychain items to be created as "default"
  even if they should have been "web form" type (thanks to Josh for the
  bug report)

1.0a6:
- fix double-prompting for authorization to access a stored password when
  visiting a page with a login form and a matching login.

1.0a5:
- compile against a universal binary gecko SDK to generate a universal binary
  dynamic library (previous versions didn't work on older PPC macs)

1.0a4:
- fixed bug that caused you to be prompted to save an autofilled password again
  when the form action "hostname" was different from that of the current page
- fixed some bugs caused by confusion between null and "" when searching for
  logins

1.0a3:
- fixed bug that left a trailing slash on the hostname when creating LoginInfos
  and caused LoginManager to always prompt to save passwords

1.0a2:
- fixed a bug was causing Form logins not to be found when searching

1.0a1:
- inital alpha release
