1.0b1:
- improve logging when creating URIs/URLs fails
- handle failure of URL creation from hostname gracefully by storing in
  legacy storage instead (these can later be stored as generic items maybe)
- If no items are found while searching, try searching the legacy storage db.
  This bides us time until a migration is implemented... at least you can use your
  old passwords. Of course, you also aren't prompted to store them in the Keychain.
- Fix for Firefox 3.0, which doesn't have mozStorage component
- Add a getter to nsLoginInfo classes to have them lookup the password as needed
  from the converted KeychainItem. This avoids prompting the user for permission
  until Mozilla actually *needs* the password.
- Implement a basic migration when the extension is first loaded

1.0a7:
- fix problem causing all new keychain items to be created as "default"
  even if they should have been "web form" type (thanks to Josh for the
  bug report)

1.0a6:
- fix double-prompting for authorization to access a stored password when
  visiting a page with a login form and a matching login.

1.0a5:
- compile against a universal binary gecko SDK to generate a universal binary
  dynamic library (previous versions didn't work on older PPC macs)

1.0a4:
- fixed bug that caused you to be prompted to save an autofilled password again
  when the form action "hostname" was different from that of the current page
- fixed some bugs caused by confusion between null and "" when searching for
  logins

1.0a3:
- fixed bug that left a trailing slash on the hostname when creating LoginInfos
  and caused LoginManager to always prompt to save passwords

1.0a2:
- fixed a bug was causing Form logins not to be found when searching

1.0a1:
- inital alpha release
